EWPT writeup
This is a brief of my experience with the eWPT course material and the exam


Project Management Methodology
2.1 Project/Initiative Business Planning
Annual Roadmap Cycle: Review and prioritize planned initiatives over an 18-month period before execution.
One-Pager Development: Summarize the project at a high level, including preliminary cost considerations.
Business Case (BC) Development: Detail budget, hardware/software requirements, resource allocation, and risk factors. Present in Excel summaries and PowerPoint as needed.
2.2 Project Lifecycle Management
Initiation:
Create a One-Pager, Business Case, Project Charter (high-level business case summary), and Project Approval Form (PAF) to secure budget and outline WBS.
Identify initial KPIs and estimate timelines.
Planning:
Develop a comprehensive WBS, establish resource plans, and forecast spending.
Monitor potential roadblocks (technical, financial, stakeholder).
Execution:
Assemble the project team, manage daily tasks, and track statuses.
Document observations and maintain roadblock reports.
Monitoring:
Generate monthly progress reports with a timesheet and a quarterly performance review.
Track budget vs. actual spend and maintain continuous communication.
Escalate issues through the defined escalation matrix.
Closure:
Complete a Project Closure Form (PCF).
Archive documentation, finalize reports, and gather lessons learned.

3. Definition of Roles and Responsibilities

Escalation Matrix: Defines structured escalation up to PM, Program Manager, PMO, and Steering Committee.
3.10 Budget and Spending Reporting
Monthly Tracking: Monitors spending vs. planned budget.

4. Monthly Progress Report

Quarterly Analysis: Summarizes overall project performance, spending, and timesheet data for governance review.

5. Communication Management
Procedure: Defines methods (email, meetings, dashboards) and frequency of communication.

6. Change Management Process
Change Request (CR) Procedure:
Identify change need and impacts (budget, schedule).
Produce a Change Request Form.
Secure approvals based on the budgetary constraints and authority levels.
Update project baselines.
Budgetary Constraints: Evaluate cost impact and ensure any new spend aligns with the approved PAF or additional approvals.
Performance KPIs
Schedule Adherence: Track milestone completion vs. planned dates.
Budget & Spending Performance (Cost Adherence): Monitor actual spend against forecast.
Resource Utilization: Leverage timesheet data to optimize team workloads.

8. Templates and Documentation

Project Charter: Summarizes the business case and outlines governance.
PAF (Project Approval Form): Secures official budget approval (one-page summary).
WBS Creation: Establishes tasks, milestones, and resource allocations.
Project Closure:

Project Change Request:
Change Request Form: Captures details on scope changes, budget impacts, and approval workflow.

9. Governance and Reporting Flow
Initiation: Create One-Pager and PAF → PMO validates feasibility → Steering Committee endorses.
Execution & Monitoring: Monthly progress reports → Planning & Control → Steering Committee reviews.
Closure: Compile closure pack → PMO archives final documentation → Lessons learned for future projects.
